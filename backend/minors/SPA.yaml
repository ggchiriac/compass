  Students wishing to complete a minor in the Department of Spanish and 
  Portuguese must complete the Minor Application Form. <br> <br>

  Applications may be submitted as early as the second semester of the 
  sophomore year, after a major has been declared. We highly recommend 
  students apply by the Spring term of their junior year to ensure 
  course plans can be built accordingly. Applications will be accepted 
  no later than February 15 of the senior year. <br> <br>

  Students who want to minor in both Spanish or Portuguese and the 
  Program in Latin American Studies can do so with the permission of 
  both program directors, which includes a conversation about course 
  plans. In agreement with the Program in Latin American Studies 
  (PLAS), one course can be used towards both a minor in SPA or POR and 
  a minor in PLAS.

    Five SPA or cross-listed courses (two at the 200-level and three at 
    the 300-level or higher). Up to one cross-listed course taken in 
    English can count towards the minor, provided that all written work 
    is completed in Spanish. Note that all Princeton summer courses in 
    Spain and Argentina offered by SPO count towards the requirement. 
    <br> <br>

    Up to one course per semester taken abroad at another institution 
    can count towards the minor with the pre-approval of the DUS. 
    Students intending to study abroad must contact the DUS with the 
    description and syllabus of the Spanish course they intend to have 
    counted towards the minor to make sure that such course is 
    equivalent to a course offered at Princeton.

    <i>Editor's Note: Students do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so hoagieplan does not check it.</i><br><br>

    A capstone assignment in Spanish consisting of a 1500-word 
    reflection on how the student’s work in the minor has informed 
    their learning in their major coursework and potentially their 
    independent work. <br> <br>

    The assignment should be independently carried out during the 
    student’s senior year. It must be submitted to the Undergraduate 
    Administrator and the Director of Undergraduate Studies no later 
    than one week after the Senior Thesis submission deadline.
