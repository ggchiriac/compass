type: Minor
name: History of Art
code: ART
degree:
description: The Department of Art and Archaeology studies artwork and 
  material artifacts from a wide range of cultures and periods, approaching 
  them in historical perspective. Art history’s subjects include drawing, 
  painting, sculpture, photography, architecture and the built environment, 
  ceramics, lacquer, metalwork, glass and textiles; along with a wide range 
  of images and phenomena or experiences shaped by artistic craft, including
  cinema, performance, print culture, urbanism, scientific illustration and 
  mass media. Students of art history learn to translate observations into 
  linguistic expression, develop visual and experiential memory and make 
  connections among a wide array of historical evidence. They practice 
  techniques for analyzing and interpreting the visual and material world 
  by actively engaging primary sources—often through the direct study of 
  original works in Princeton’s collections and local museums.

  Art historians pursue their work in many different ways, and the research 
  questions of the field take varied forms. The fundamental methods of the 
  discipline rely on close observation and deeply researched contextualization. 
  The contemporary practice of art history attends not only to visual analysis 
  and the study of materials and techniques, but also to the full spectrum of 
  elements that bear upon art’s making and its apprehension (including sound, 
  smell, texture, motion, etc. — all in historically situated context). 
  Art-historical research often considers the social, political, philosophical, 
  literary, economic, scientific, technological or religious culture of a 
  particular period, community or region. Art historians frequently collaborate 
  with scholars in the sciences as they study the material composition of 
  artworks, and the field is conducive to technology-based projects and methods 
  (such as imaging technologies and data visualization).

  "The field is by nature interdisciplinary:" it draws on the ideas, information, 
  theories and resources of diverse branches of knowledge, as art historians 
  seek to understand the cultural fabric of which a given work of art forms a 
  part. As such, a minor in the History of Art may complement a major in a wide 
  range of disciplines across all University divisions. The skills of 
  observation, analysis and research that students cultivate through 
  art-historical practice prove valuable in fields from medicine and law to 
  engineering and biological- or conservation science, along with all branches 
  of the humanities and social sciences.

    Minors must take one course in each of the department’s three 
    distribution areas: Ancient (Group 1), Medieval and Early Modern 
    (Group 2), Modern (Group 3). This distribution requirement may be met 
    through courses at any level, and in any geographic area. Group 
    designations are included in the Registrar’s course listings, and will 
    also be communicated to students through a department announcement when 
    course registration opens.

    With the exception of cross-listed courses taught by core Art & 
    Archaeology faculty, no cross-lists or cognates will count toward 
    the minor (i.e., unless taught by core faculty, all courses must carry 
    ART as the first or only subject code).
