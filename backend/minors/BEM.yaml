description:  Drawing on Princeton's strengths in bioengineering, 
both within the Omenn-Darling Bioengineering Institute and across 
the broader campus, the Bioengineering Minor will provide rigorous 
classroom and research experiences, enabling our students to gain 
expertise and make important contributions to this critically 
important field.

  explanation: Three courses with bioengineering content, selected from the
  list established for the Engineering Biology Certificate. These courses 
  should provide a coherent training in an area of bioengineering, such as 
  biotechnology, molecular or cellular engineering, neuroengineering, or 
  systems biology.

  explanation: One advanced life science course, selected from the approved 
  list. This course should provide additional insight into complex living 
  systems and complement the bioengineering courses chosen by the student.

  description: To promote thinking about the ethical aspects of 
  bioengineering and its effects on society, students are required to 
  attend the Omenn-Darling Bioethics Lecture once during their Princeton 
  career and write a short (1-2 page single spaced) reflection on what was 
  discussed and how it relates to topics in bioengineering, due to Jessica 
  Varela (jvarela@princeton.edu). The Lecture is typically held in early 
  March; the reflection is due by April 1st of the same year in which the 
  lecture was held. A recording will be made available for students who 
  are unable to attend the lecture in person.

  description: Students are required to complete at least one semester or 
  summer of Bioengineering research in an appropriate area of engineering 
  biology. This research requirement can be a component of the student's 
  senior thesis or senior independent research, or be satisfied by either 
  of the two Bioengineering summer research programs recently established 
  at Princeton the Bioengineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience
  (BE-SURE) and the iGEM Synthetic Biology research project.
