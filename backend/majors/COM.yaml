      To enter the department, students must be sufficiently knowledgeable in one language other than English to take an upper-level course in it in his or her junior year.

      Plan to read a second foreign language before graduation. Proficiency in only one non-English language is required for admission to the department. However, students who major in comparative literature are also expected to study at least one other non-English language and to be able to read in the language by the time they graduate. Such language study may take place before or during their years as departmental majors. Some students demonstrate their competency by taking an upper-level course in the literature of that language. Other students gain this competency by taking three terms of language study at Princeton, or two terms and an intensive language course in the summer, or (especially in the case of languages that are no longer spoken) an intensive language course in the summer. A few take a foreign language test administered by the relevant department during the summer.

  explanation: 'Students in Comparative Literature select courses from a wide range

    of study to match their individual interests. Nine departmental courses are required
    of each student, chosen according to the type of comparative work pursued. These
    courses must be taken for a grade; no P/D/F course can be counted as a departmental
    requirement, with two exceptions: for the track courses only, you may use approved
    courses that are not offered for a grade, such as CWR and THR courses; or the
    Historical Requirement course, if it is not one of the nine departmentals. (Although,
    do note that ungraded courses cannot raise your grade point average, if that is
    needed.) The three COM courses and four reading courses must be graded. The three
    main rubrics and various tracks are listed below, as well as a description of
    the Historical Requirement.'

Those other two COM courses can be 200-, 300-, 400-, or 500-level; with the professor’s permission, advanced students may enroll in 500-level COM courses. These must be Princeton COM courses; no exceptions.</p>

      <p><i>Editor's Note: Most of these courses fall under this requirement but Compass does not verify this.</i></p>

      <p>All majors must take four 200-, 300-, 400-, or 500-level non-English-language reading-based courses. Any course at the 200-level or above taught within any language department at Princeton that is not part of a language instruction sequence may be used to fulfill the requirement, so long as it is based on the reading of texts and/or viewing of films in a non-English language. The focus of such a course must be in the language for which the student is claiming credit. A limited number of secondary readings may be in English (or some other foreign language), but the course must entail a substantial and extended engagement with materials in the original language for which the student is claiming credit. Courses that are part of a language-instruction sequence as well as grammar-review courses are normally excluded; students studying languages with fewer course offerings such as Arabic or Hindi-Urdu may petition the Director of Undergraduate Studies for permission to allow a reading-based course that is part of the language-instruction sequence. Courses do not need to be about literature; courses in film, art, history, philosophy, or the social sciences that are devoted to reading texts in the original language will also fulfill this requirement. Courses in which the primary readings are in translation cannot be counted, but those where the language of discussion and written assignments are in English are allowable. Any questions about whether a course and its readings or viewings qualify for credit should be taken up with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. In the event that a special arrangement is requested in order to claim credit for a course, students must secure such arrangements at the beginning of the semester with both the course professor and the DUS, and follow up with both the professor and DUS at the end of the semester once those conditions have been fulfilled.

      As long as all four reading courses are in non-English languages, this requirement can be fulfilled through any distribution of languages. The courses can be evenly split between two foreign languages, divided with three courses in one foreign language, and one in the other, or even distributed among three or four different languages. Students also have the option of taking all four reading courses in one foreign language, and simply demonstrating reading proficiency in the second foreign language. The Department understands proficiency as the ability to read short texts (such as a short story, poem, essay, or newspaper article) with the aid of a dictionary. The determination will be made at the discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, but typically proficiency may be established through completion of three semesters in a language sequence at Princeton, which for many languages will culminate in a course numbered 107 or 108, or by taking 200-level and higher courses in the language. Certain approved summer programs will also meet the requirement. Students interested in this latter option should confer with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.</p>

      explanation: Comparative work in literary study and the creative arts (that is, creative writing [poetry, the novel, short stories, drama, memoir], screenwriting, translation, dance, theatrical performance, visual arts, film or video). Students choose four reading-based courses in non-English-language literature; three courses listed or cross-listed with comparative literature (one of which is COM 300); and two courses in the relevant creative art. Both courses must be in the same area of study. 
      
        Students entering the department select this program provisionally. Final admission depends upon the acceptance of the creative thesis proposal by the department and by an adviser from the relevant creative arts program.

Its purpose is to develop the student's basic skills as a reader of complex texts. The second paper should be wider in scope, and might serve as the beginnings of a senior thesis. It will normally be some 8,000 words in length.</p>

    <p>Majors must take the senior departmental examination, which is a written exam to test their ability to analyze texts and make connections among them. The student consults with their senior faculty adviser to select specific titles from a broad reading list, reads them and answers questions based on the student's particular language proficiency and chosen program of study. Students will also be asked to analyze a passage in their primary language.</p>
