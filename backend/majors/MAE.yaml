description: |-
  The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering is concerned
  with the engineering science and technologies associated with 
  ground, air, water, and space transportation, including control and
  dynamics of vehicles and systems, energy conversion and use, 
  environmental effects, fluids, materials, and applied physics. To
  accommodate this breadth of interest, the Department offers two
  programs of study: Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering.
  Either program may be completed individually or, through careful
  planning and selection of technical electives, the requirements of
  both the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering programs may be 
  satisfied simultaneously. (See the Director of Undergraduate 
  Studies for further information).

- name: Senior Independent Work
  max_counted: 1
  min_needed: 1
  explanation: |-
    Senior Independent Work is the culminating experience for the mechanical and aerospace
    engineering programs. All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering
    project. All projects must include elements of engineering design (engineering design is the
    process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following
    courses satisfy this requirement: MAE 439 Senior Independent Work (one semester, fall);<br>
    MAE 440 Senior Independent Work (one semester, spring);<br> MAE 442 Senior Thesis (yearlong);<br>
    MAE 444 Senior Project (year-long).<br> Students are strongly encouraged to select
    the year-long project or thesis option. Senior projects are intended for teams or groups
    while senior thesis is intended for individuals. For senior project or thesis, work begins in
    the fall but enrollment is only in spring term when a double grade is awarded. <br>Please note:
    If a student has selected to participate in a year-long project or thesis and is enrolled in only
    three courses during the fall semester, it is required that they will enroll in Senior Project or
    Thesis during the spring semester. For these students, it will NOT be possible to drop-down
    to a one-semester course of Independent Work without incurring a failure for Independent
    Work in the fall term. In Spring term you must enroll in three courses plus senior thesis or
    senior project (senior thesis and senior project count as two courses). Therefore your senior
    year course load will be 3 in fall and 5 in spring as opposed to 4 in fall and 4 in spring.<br>
    There are NO exceptions to this rule even if your total number of courses will exceed 36.
